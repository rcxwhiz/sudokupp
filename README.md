# Sudokupp

This is a Sudoku solver written in C++. You feed it a file representing a game board with numbers and non whitespace
characters for unsolved cells. The solver can solve most puzzles so far, but it is (currently) incapable of using
certain advanced solving techniques required to solve advanced puzzles.
